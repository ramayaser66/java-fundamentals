lab-6 
 - we built a class called Restaurant that takes in a string name, an int stars and an int price. 

 it has a constructor that builds each restaurant. 
 with a condition that the stars should be form 0 to 5. 

 it contains a addReview method that adds a review for each restaurant. 

 also it contains a method called toString that we can override the object class
 so  we can get the data for the object itself not the address. 

 - we built another class called review that takes in a string body, a string author and an integer numberOfStars.

 it has a constructor that creates reviews for the restaurant.
the review class is extended to the restaurant class so that I can add a review to a specified restaurant using the name of that restaurant and I can edit the starts number with the new review by adding numberOfStars.
